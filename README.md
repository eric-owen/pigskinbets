## Description

Our website allows users to sign in with Google, place a bet of their choosing - Spread, Moneyline, Over/Under - and win some cash.

## Scope of functionalities

Our bets page leverages a live sports API which provides statistics across all teams including but not limited to: Scores, Records, Schedules, Logos, Team Colors, Odds and Location. After logging in, users are able to place their wagers through our Bets page which feeds into our database. The odds are updated every 3 minutes to ensure users have the most up to date and accurate information. Bets are only allowed to be placed on games that are not in progress.
